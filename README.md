# IOT-Hotel-Room-Protection
ESP8266 based project for securing hotel rooms

## Why do I need this ?

This hardware hack enables hotel goers to monitor when their hotel room door has been opened in order to provide piece of mind while travelling. It will all be housed in a covert shell disguised as a "do not disturb" sign providing discretion to the user. 

## How it's all done

This hack utilises the esp 8266 platform mated with an accelerometer, which if all goes well will be housed in a 3d printed encolsure on top of which a do not disturb sign will be clipped on. This hardware will be working in symphony with a sinatra webserver which will host the user interface for the client side of the hardware hack displaying different updates about the status of the sign.

## What has been done so far ?

### Februrary 20th 2018 Update 1

So far the scripting part of the hack for the esp microcontroller is being worked on and tweaked. The most difficult part is tweaking the accelerometer and making sur it's properaly sensitized. I have also started work on the backend api services for logging all the data coming. I have also started to look into simple 3d modelling software as potential candidates for creating the enclosure.

I have started designing the 3d component and will be posting regular updates of my progress.
